                    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wingsare too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anywaybecause bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast isready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this ishappening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid goodmoney for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. Aperfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma!

Barry, I told you, stop flying in thehouse! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Neverthought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward.Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did comeback different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? -Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, youdie. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of theway. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't needvacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we aremen. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, pleasewelcome Dean Buzzwell.
